# Trade-Union-Analysis


## Method
This analysis will be conducted using the following programs: R programming and Tableau.

This project explores unions and their relationship to each other and the nation-states that govern them. So far, there will be four analyses: a linear regression analysis exploring the relationship between union density and collective bargaining agreement coverage. A time series analysis of the trade union database on the state of unions globally and in the United States. A comparative analysis between the United States and the rest of the world. Lastly, a descriptive analysis consisting of frequency tables will analyze the whole trade union database.


## About The Datasets
### Stata


Level of national compliance with labor rights, 2021
The indicator has a range from 0 to 10, with 0 being the best possible score (indicating higher levels of compliance withfundamental rights at work) and 10 the worst (indicating lower levels of compliance with fundamental rights at work).

"The trade union density is defined as the number of net union members (i.e excluding those who are not in the labor force, unemployed and self-employed) as a proportion of the number of employees. Data reported in this Table refer to the UD_hist variable of the OECD/AIAS ICTWSS database and combine estimates based either on administrative sources labor force surveys or both. For more information and full methodology."

"The adjusted collective bargaining coverage rate is defined as the number of employees covered by a collective agreement in force as a proportion of the number of eligible employees equipped (i.e., the total number of employees minus the number of employees legally excluded from the right to bargain). Data reported in this Table refer to the AdjCov_hist variable of the OECD/AIAS ICTWSS database and combine estimates based either on administrative sources labor force surveys or both. For more information and full methodology.

The collective bargaining coverage rate represents the share of workers covered by valid collective agreements in force. What counts as a valid collective agreement in force is defined by international and national legislations and, in some cases, tribunals. The OECD/AIAS ICTWSS database follows the rules and definitions of the ILO (ILO (2018), Quick guide on sources and uses of collective bargaining statistics, International Labour Organization, Geneva). In particular, only agreements negotiated by independent representation, i.e. bona fide trade unions, are considered. However, at this stage, given the limited sources available, it is not possible to fully rule that, in a few instances, the data might also include some agreements negotiated by non-union bodies. But the problem, if confirmed, would be small and not much to put in question the comparability of the estimates."

## Small Multiple Line Graph Union Density.

Union Density is the measure of the amount of employees within a country's industries who are members of a union. The graphs below show union density throughout 4 to 5 years.
