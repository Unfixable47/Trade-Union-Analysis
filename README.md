# Trade-Union-Analysis
This project explores unions and their relationship to each other and the nation-states that govern them. So far, there will be four analyses: a linear regression analysis exploring the relationship between union density and collective bargaining agreement coverage. A time series analysis of the trade union database on the state of unions globally and in the United States. A comparative analysis between the United States and the rest of the world. Lastly, a descriptive analysis consisting of frequency tables will analyze the whole trade union database.

## Method
This analysis will be conducted using the following programs: R programming and Tableau.

## References
below are some sources used when researching the current state of trade unions, and the effect they have within the nation-states they operate within.
