# Trade-Union-Analysis
This project explores unions and their relationship to each other and the nation-states that govern them. So far there will be 4 analyses: a linear regression analysis exploring the relationship between union density and collective bargaining agreement coverage. A time series analysis of the trade union database on both the state of unions globally and in the United States. A comparative analysis between the United States compared the rest of the world. Lastly, a descriptive analysis consisting of frequency tables will be utilized to analyze the whole trade union database. 

## Method
This analysis will be conducted using the following programs: R programming and Tableau.
